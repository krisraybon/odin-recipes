The Odin Project Foundations Course: Project 1: first project in module. Set up Git repo via github.com followed by cloning the repo to my external hard drive in Terminal. Process took about 40 mins. Initially, I created the repo on Github desktop. Then told myself to push and try via Terminal as it's an essential skill to learn and start practicing. Proud of myself for conquering it this 1st time and not being intimidated about the process.
